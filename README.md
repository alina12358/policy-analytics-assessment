# policy-analytics-assessment
Base repository for the Data Scientist Technical Assessment (IDB). Provides a reproducible structure, Conda environment (Python 3.12), and a bootstrap script to create/update the environment. Raw data is not versioned; external links and local paths should be used. Outputs and artifacts are generated after the pipeline is implemented.
